            <p>
                I am a software consultant currently working at Pariveda Solutions. I graduated from UGA (Go Dawgs!) in
                2016 where I started my professional career at UPS as an application developer. Most of my experience
                has
                been in Java, Python, and SQL. I have worked with Azure Logic Apps, Azure Databricks, and Azure Purview.
                I am also working on my web dev abilities and familiarizing myself with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more
                to
                come!
            <br><br>
                In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games like The Last of Us (1 and 2!), God of War ("Boy!"
                -Kratos),
                Fifa (career mode FTW), Red Dead, and way too many to list!
