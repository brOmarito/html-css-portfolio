# html-css-portfolio
The following project is meant to serve as a portfolio to represent familiarity with pure HTML and CSS. Bootstrap, JavaScript, and all that fancy stuff were not used in making this portfolio page in order to practice what is available only through using CSS and HTML. It contains a quick about me, some of the projects/applications I have worked on, and some means to contact me (No phone number just for privacy sake but can always reach out on something like Discord).üï∏Ô∏è

## What was the point?
There were two main reasons I worked on this portfolio:
1. The obvious one, to have a portfolio that I could share and link projects/applications from.
2. The other reason was to get some practice working with pure HTML and CSS with no help from things like Bootstrap, for example.

## Lessons Learned
Coming into this, I did not have any experience with FlexBox. I'm by no means a master at it now but definitely more familiar with it and got the opportunity to play around with having different instances of FlexBox nested within each other and dealing with those nuances. That was my favorite part about this and seeing how much was possible with that.

## Improvements
Obviously, there's always room for improvement and I will likely continue to play around with this here and there but here are some things I wanted to get around to at some point. Honestly, this serves as a wishlist of sorts for me so I don't forget any ideas.üï∑
* Add a carousel of a bunch of pictures of me, my dog, and my loved ones (Yes, BMO gets a specific mention). Haven't decided if that would mean scrapping the main picture as it is now or maybe adding it as a strip below. We'll climb that mountain when we get there.
* Add a hover over picture of BMO over his name in the About Me section.
* Crop out the part of the picture of me and the Spider-Man suit and put it on a more solid background that could potentially be applied to the whole site, giving it a more clean and modern aesthetic.
* Add some more pages and potentially make this a jumping off point for my own website complete with some music album reviews, movie reviews, video game screenshots, and anything else that interests me!
* Last but not least, I stumbled a little with the nested flexbox in the Projects section. I was hoping to get them to wrap to where the main would be first (found how to do this but it squished the others) and then the horizontal projects would be two per line after.

## Notes
* I mention in my notes of finding a new way to make a whole div which was my project cards as a link. I would have never thought of creating a span that would provide the functionality of the link but great to know!
* A part of me wanted to make a very modern and mainstream site but I also wanted to add some of my personality into my portfolio. I will have more opportunities to create more mainstream (is that the right word) designed websites through other projects or freelance work but since this one is a bit closer to heart ‚ù§Ô∏è.
